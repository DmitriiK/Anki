Please give me the list, based on the  100 most frequent  verbs from Turkish language. (Let's call it 'source language')
It should contain following fields:
- word from source language.
- It's translations to English (let's call it 'target' language). 
It should be list, as if  the word has different not similar meaning, it should contain all of them (but not more than 3). 
But if the meanings of he word are similar, like "make" and "do" for "etmek", please take only one of them. 
- Example of usage for each of the meanings, with different grammar forms of the word, as a  sentence in source language,  
containing 4-10 words for each of the examples. The root part of initial word should be separated in "<bold> tag. 
The words in examples should be from top 1000 of most frequent words in source language. 
- Translations to target language for each of the above examples. The translated word should be included in bold tag.
--
So, basically for one source word we can have from one to three target words, translations with different meanings,
and for each of them we should provide one example of usage, so that size of lists "target_words",      "source_examples",
      "target_examples" should be the same.
      
The output format should be json, without any additional explanations.
Example of the item in json,  for pair of languages Turkish->English :
  {
      "source_word": "istemek",
      "target_words": ["to want"],
      "source_examples": ["O zamana kadar, başka bir şey hakkında düşünmek <bold>iste</bold>miyorum. "]
      "target_examples": ["Until then, I don't , ,<bold>want</bold> to think about other stuff."]

    },
